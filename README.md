# Intrusion-Detection-Lab

## Objective

The Snort project aimed to monitor and detect any suspicious network traffic on a home network. The primary focus was to analyze network data for potential threats and generate alerts in response to abnormal patterns. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of intrusion detection, network security, and threat analysis.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of Snort as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and its practical application in network monitoring.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network traffic for suspicious activity.
- Ability to configure Snort rules and recognize malicious signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols, packet analysis, and security threats.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in detecting and mitigating network vulnerabilities.

### Tools Used

- Snort Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for monitoring and detecting suspicious network traffic.
- Nmap for network scanning and generating traffic to test Snort detection capabilities.
- Custom Snort rule configuration for identifying and responding to specific network behaviors and threats.
